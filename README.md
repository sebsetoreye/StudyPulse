# StudyPulse
This is an application desinged for students, enabling them to do a wide range of tasks, to help with school

For people installing this program, You should add your own Google API key, as I am not releasing mine

there are also a couple of things you need to install before you can run the program. 

#INSTALLING
You can run either the INSTALL script ( by renaming it to .bat ), or the commands down below.

#
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

pip install ollama
#

#To run locally without the server intergrated, you need to install ollama from their website (https://ollama.com/download) you also need to install the model phi:3. this is until I set up the server.

#Management of data
This program saves data on google Calender, and currently has no local save.


I will continue updating and developing this, to add these features later on.

- Update code for server compatibility.

- Create, it as an Application for Android phones ( work in progress )
